        A real-time car parking system that provides directions to your parking slot is a technology-based solution that aims to solve the challenge of finding a parking slot in busy parking areas. 
        This system utilizes various technologies such as sensors, location, and data analysis to track available parking spaces and guide drivers to the closest available slot.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system works by installing sensors at various points within the parking lot, which detect the presence or absence of vehicles in each parking space. The data collected from these sensors is then analyzed in real-time to determine which parking slots are available and which are occupied.

        Using this information, the system then provides drivers with real-time guidance on the location of available parking spaces and the best route to reach them. This can be done using a mobile app, a dashboard display.
